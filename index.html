<!-- Good work on using the reset.css file. Look to focus on aligning your elements better - your header and body content are not aligned correctly which can throw off the user. With regards to css you are adding styling to html elements liberally - this will make your site very brittle and resistant to change - use classes unless it's something you are sure that should apply to all elements of that type (such as a universal font). Also - excellent indentation. -->
